# Bayesian Inference HW

**Instructions:**

1. Run MrBayes on your project data. You can always choose another bayesian implementation, but make sure to read the paper and tutorial carefully.
  - Don't forget to include in your reproducible script a short description of the chosen algorithm, its assumptions and limitations (see the [software cheatsheet](https://github.com/crsl4/phylogenetics-class/blob/master/exercises/software-cheatsheet.md))
2. Make sure to keep notes in your reproducible script and keep the most updated version on github (it is important to push your work to github since this allows me to check what you are doing and offer suggestions)
3. Submit the link to your github commit in canvas

**Note:** You do not need to have the output of the method to submit the HW, only need the commands you used.
