# Lecture 15

### Previous class check-up
- We studied the theory of coalescent models on trees and on networks
- We studied ASTRAL, BUCKy and the PhyloNetworks pipeline from sequences to species tree/network

### Learning objectives

At the end of today's session, you will be able to
- identify the main parts of co-estimation methods
- follow the BEAST tutorial

### Pre-class work

- Optional reading HB 18

# In-class dynamic: Taming the BEAST tutorial


Instructions: Choose a tutorial from the whole list of [BEAST tutorials](https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/). Two that stand out: 

- [Intro to BEAST](https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/Introduction-to-BEAST2/)
- [Multispecies coalescent on *BEAST](https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/StarBeast-Tutorial/)

Create our own reproducible script.

# For next class

- We will go over BEAST papers
- Each student is assigned to one group:
  - Group 1 will read BEAST paper 1: [Drummond and Rambaut, 2007](https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-7-214)
  - Group 2 will read BEAST paper 2: [Bouckaert et al 2019](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006650)
- We will have a class discussion followed that more work on the software
