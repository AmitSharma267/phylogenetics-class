# Lecture 15

### Previous class check-up
- We studied the theory of coalescent models on trees and on networks
- We studied the PhyloNetworks pipeline from sequences to species tree/network

### Learning objectives

At the end of today's session, you will be able to
- identify the main parts of co-estimation methods
- follow the BEAST tutorial

### Pre-class work

- Optional reading HB 18

# In-class dynamic: Taming the BEAST tutorial

Time: 15 minutes

Instructions: Choose a tutorial from the whole list of [BEAST tutorials](https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/). Two that stand out: 

- [Intro to BEAST](https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/Introduction-to-BEAST2/)
- [Multispecies coalescent on *BEAST](https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/StarBeast-Tutorial/)

Create our own reproducible script.

Options for you:
1. "I think that I can follow the pipeline by myself or with a small group of peers": you should join the Congregate room
2. "I think I need more one-on-one help to run the commands": you can stay here in the zoom room
