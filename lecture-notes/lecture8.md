# Lecture 8 (draft)

### Previous class check-up
- We studied the algorithms for orthology detection: MCL graph clustering ideas in OrthoFinder
- We learned about OrthoFinder as one option for software

### Learning objectives

At the end of today's session, you will be able to
- explain both algorithms to reconstruct trees: 1) based on distances and 2) based on parsimony
- assess the strenghts and weaknesses of every approach
- use Phylip or PAUP for tree estimation

### Pre-class work

- Optional readings: HB Ch 5-6, Baum Ch 7-8

# Distance-based methods

- Fit a tree to a matrix of pairwise genetic distances
- For every two sequences, the distance corresponds to the fraction of positions in which the two sequences differ (p-distance)
- The p-distance underestimates the true genetic distance $d$
- Thus, we do not use the p-distances as the pairwise distances but instead we estimate the number of substitutions that occurred by applying a specific evolutionary model

# Distance-based methods

- We will assume that the genetic distances have been estimated using an appropriate evolutionary model (more on Lectures 8 and 10)
- The main distance-ased tree building methods are:
  - cluster analysis
  - minimum evolution
